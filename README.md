# TravellingSalesmanProblem
The travelling salesman problem, also known as the travelling salesperson problem, asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

In construction_method.c, I used the combine of these algorithms:
- Nearest Neighbor
- Nearest Insertion
- Cheapest Insertion
- Furthest Insertion
- Minimum Spanning Tree

In improve_method.c, I prefered to use:
- 2-OPTs
- Or-OPT
- Simulate Annealing

I had an idea of implementing Christofides algorithm using MST and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching to get a result approximately 1.5 compared to the perfect one. But due to the limit of time, I have not written it yet.
